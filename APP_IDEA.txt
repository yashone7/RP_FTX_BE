=============================

Converting unorganized sector to organized sector in medical 
sales distribution

problem
=====================

current business scenario is as follows, the medecine distributors have 
a couple retailers who place orders to the distributors and then pay them
back in cheque or cash or dd. And the sales boys are in charge of collecting 
the payment.

solution
=====================
Introducing simplified way to receive payments and honor you retailers' requests
using __APP_NAME__ 

-> settle payments quickly (day-1 payments)
-> get insights and analytics related to individual clients 

======================================================================
